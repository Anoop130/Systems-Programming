This program will use the file created in Program 3 labeled "angl.dat".

The goal of this program is to read the roll, pitch, and yaw values from the file and then report if the roll and pitch are inside or outside of a given range; the range we will use is -20.0 to 20.0.

Your program should read one set of roll, pitch, and yaw values each second (remember that you have written doubles, so read doubles); it should verify if each the roll and pitch are inside the range of -20.0 to 20.0 and report the results. 

You can and should use nanosleep for this program, program 5 will use interval timers to accomplish the same task.

Here is a working data file:

A few notes about this file: it contains doubles written out in the order roll, pitch, yaw.
