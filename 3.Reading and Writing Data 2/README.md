This program will use the data file created in Program 2, by default that file should be "data.dat".

This program should should do the following:

1. create a directory named "values"
2. create the files "accl.dat", "rota.dat", "angl.dat" in the new directory
3. open the "data.dat" file 
4. read aX, aY, and aY then store them in "accl.dat"
5. read roll, pitch, and yaw the store them in "angl.dat"
6. read wX, wY, and wZ then store them in "rota.dat"

You should check the data sheet provided in program 2 to determine which values those are.

Just like "data.dat," the other ".dat" files should be stored in a binary format and won't be readable using
a text editor. Make certain to perform all file access using the read, write, open, and close system 
commands for this program.
